## Description
I initiated the development of this website in 2022 during my college years. Despite contemplating the creation of a new website post-graduation, I decided to complete this project. The primary goal was to establish a platform showcasing my skills, experiences, and accomplishments.

Throughout the development journey, I honed my expertise in 3D modeling, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless and dynamic user experience. This project has not only served as a showcase for my achievements but has also been instrumental in deepening my understanding of web development and design, with a particular focus on responsive design. Notably, the website is meticulously crafted to be responsive, guaranteeing optimal viewing across various mobile devices. 

As of now, this project remains ongoing, and I am committed to continuously updating and improving its content and features.
